# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

# Ironhack Data Analytics Organization (October - December 2023)

Welcome to the GitHub organization dedicated to showcasing the projects I completed during my Data Analytics course at Ironhack, from the 8th of October to the 8th of December, 2023.

## About This Organization
This organization serves as a comprehensive hub for my learning journey at Ironhack. It houses a series of repositories, each representing a different lab or project I worked on, focusing primarily on data analytics and machine learning. These repositories collectively reflect the growth and skills I developed in various tools, technologies, and methodologies essential for a career in these fields.

### Key Technologies and Topics Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: Essential Python libraries for data processing and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for data visualization, these libraries helped in creating insightful graphs and plots.
- **SQL**: Employed for database management and data querying.
- **Tableau**: Utilized for creating interactive and shareable dashboards.
- **Machine Learning**: Basics of machine learning, predictive modeling using `sklearn`, logistic regression, and other algorithms.

## Project Overview
Each repository within this organization is a testament to the practical and theoretical knowledge I gained at Ironhack in both data analytics and machine learning. Here's a brief overview of what you can find:

- **Python Labs**: Repositories containing exercises and mini-projects focusing on Python programming, particularly using Pandas and Numpy for data analysis.
- **Visualization Projects**: Repositories showcasing my ability to translate data insights into visual narratives using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau.
- **SQL Queries**: Repositories with a collection of SQL scripts used for data extraction and manipulation from various databases.
- **Machine Learning Projects**: Detailed repositories covering the basics of machine learning, predictive analytics using `sklearn`, logistic regression, and other machine learning methodologies.

## Navigation Tips
- Navigate through the organization to explore different repositories, each dedicated to a specific project or lab.
- Each repository contains a detailed README file explaining the project's objectives, the methodologies used, and insights derived.
- For an overarching view, refer to this README which acts as a guide to what you can find across this organization.

## Getting Started
To explore these projects, start by visiting the individual repositories within this organization. If you're interested in running the code, make sure you have the required technologies installed. Detailed setup instructions and project details are provided in the README of each repository.


Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find these projects informative and inspiring!
